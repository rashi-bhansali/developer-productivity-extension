DevInks is a Chrome extension that allows you to take rich markdown notes and code snippets directly on any webpage. The extension supports both dark mode and light mode, provides a user-friendly Markdown toolbar, and preserves note states between sessions—ensuring your notes are always there when you need them.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**:  
  Create and edit notes with full Markdown support. A dedicated Markdown toolbar helps you quickly insert headings, bold text, italics, strikethrough, underline, code blocks, and more.

- **Markdown/Rendered Toggle**:  
Easily switch between raw markdown editing and rendered markdown preview. When rendered, the Markdown toolbar is hidden for a distraction-free reading experience.

- **Python Code Snippets with Syntax Highlighting**:  
  Add Python code cells to your notes. The code editor supports syntax highlighting, making it easy to read and maintain python code snippets directly within your notes.

- **Dark Mode Compatibility**:  
  The extension automatically respects system-level dark mode preferences. A toggle button also lets you manually switch between light and dark modes, providing a comfortable writing environment for any lighting condition.

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:  
  Speed up your workflow with keyboard shortcuts for common formatting actions (e.g., `Ctrl+B`/`⌘B` for bold, `Ctrl+I`/`⌘I` for italic, and so forth), without interfering with standard browser shortcuts like copy and paste.

- **Persistent Notes**:  
  Notes are saved and persisted using IndexedDB. Even after you close the extension or restart your browser, your notes remain intact.
